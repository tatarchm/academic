I am a research scientist at the Bosch Center For AI in Renningen. I received my PhD in 2020 from the Freiburg University supervised by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Thomas Brox. In 2017 I interned at the Intel Intelligent Systems Lab with Dr. Vladlen Koltun. I received my MSc in Computer Science from the University of Freiburg in 2015, and a BSc in Applied Mathematics from Russian State Technological University 'MATI' in 2011.
